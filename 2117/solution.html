 <h4>The final deliverables are designed for two distinct users. The Experience Builder web map application which is designed for desktop users are referred as ‘dispatchers’, and Field Map application which is designed for mobile users are referred as ‘mobile users.
Since both web applications are not intended for public use, users are required to login to their ESRI’s ArcGIS account. Only users who are organization members with shared access have access to the application.

 <p><h4>The folllowing is a list of deliverables and description of the formatto br presented.
As wellthe date for completion of each of the client deliverable.</h4>

 <h4>Both web applications in Experience Builder and Field Maps achieved the projects three objectives in creating an identification for all campus rooms, creating an operation picture including self-location and tracking user function, as well as a query function to search for a specific room. 
 On top of room searching, dispatchers using the desktop application Experience Builder would have more access to utilities such as customizable filters, therefore making this application more suitable for providing navigation assistance and more information on the campus map.  On the other hand, mobile users using Field Maps app can locate themselves, identify their point of interest, and navigate themselves to their destination. They also have more access to collect and edit the feature, providing more campus data to the dispatchers  which can used to create different widgets for different purposes. It is a mutual benefit solution for both desktop users and mobile users. 
<p><p>One major problem for this project, ‘most of the campus buildings are coded as 75 University Avenue West’, could be solved by labelling the name of each building in this address. Users could know their location and building names are showing in the web map application, they should be able to learn the location of each building and their means to reach there, without have trouble of getting lost and confusion. And even users might get confused or lost, both Experience Builder and Field Maps are able to search building names and alias on top of room search, optimizing user-friendliness and real-life application.
With this project’s solution, Laurier Special Constables, and other potential users such as Waterloo City’s first responder would have a better means of navigation and improve their performance by increasing travel efficiency and decreasing travel time by the high-quality web map application from this project.
