<h4>Ideal</h4>


An easy to use, fully functional developed Android/iOS App used by firefighters to provide real time data collection, access, and mapping functions for the Kawartha Lakes Fire Rescue Team's Smoke and CO Alarm Program. 


 


<h4>Reality</h4>


Currently data is collected manually by firefighters visiting each location and results from home visit forms tabulated into a master tracking sheet. The process does not allow for real time tracking and has potential for data loss by paper tabulation. 


 


<h4>Consequences </h4>
The current process is time consuming and allows for the possibility of losing data, time is wasted when the fire department visit homes that does not need an inspection, as well the effectiveness of this community safety program's purpose is affected. 


<h4>Proposal </h4>


We would use Geocortex as specified by the client to create a web app for data collection, and the opportunity for a connected website for residents to "opt out" of the Smoke and CO Alarm Program inspection exists. A web-map of fire data would also be created. Further research into the limits of Geocort
